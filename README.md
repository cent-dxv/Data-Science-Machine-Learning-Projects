* Here I have uploaded 2 versions of this project. Difference between these two versions is Feature Selection based on correlation.
* Version 1 : This [Notebook](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Machine-Learning-Classification-And-Regression-Projects/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification%201.ipynb) contains simple method for feature selection based on correlation with target attribute.
* Version 2 : This [Notebook](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Machine-Learning-Classification-And-Regression-Projects/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification%202.ipynb) contains logistic regression method for feature selection based on column's accuracy.
