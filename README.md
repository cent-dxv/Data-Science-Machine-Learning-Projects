This Repository Contains different Machine Learning Projects on various dataset. From Exploratory Data Analysis - Visualization to Prediction and Classification.

# Breast Cancer Classification

* Dataset used : [Click here to download](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
* Here I have uploaded 2 versions of this project. Difference between these two versions is Feature Selection based on correlation.
* Both version contains in-depth insight into Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization and Data Preparation.
* Also tried various methods for data preparation like handle outliers and data imbalance.
* Version 1 : This [Notebook](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification%201.ipynb) contains simple method for feature selection based on correlation with target attribute.
* Version 2 : This [Notebook](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification%202.ipynb) contains logistic regression method for feature selection based on column's accuracy.
* Able to got ~100% accuracy.

# Red Wine Quality Prediction Classification

* Dataset used : [Click here to download](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
* Notebook contains in-depth insight into Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization and Data Preparation.
* This [Notebook](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Red%20Wine%20Quality.ipynb) contains simple method for feature selection based on correlation with target attribute.
* Tried different algorithms for classification and got ~98% accuracy.
